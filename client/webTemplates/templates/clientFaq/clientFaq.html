    <h2>How Does Trottr Work?</h2>
    <p>Download the app from the app store or sign up online at Trottr.us</p>
    <p>Enter your pup’s info and your preference for walk duration. You can choose between 15-minute walks, 30-minute walks, 45-minute walks and 60-minute walks. You can easily change walk durations at any time in the app. </p> 
    <p>Search through walkers in your local area. Most of our walkers are less than five miles away. We’d like to think you and your walker are neighbors. </p>
    <p>Schedule a free meet and greet with the walker of your choice to make sure they are the perfect match for your pup.
    After you and your pup meet and approve a walker, you can then schedule walks.</p>

    <h2>How does the walker gain access to my home?</h2>
    <p>There are only a few ways:</p>
    <p>Give the walker the location of a hide-a-key <br>
    Purchase a lock box and give the walker the combination<br>
    Leave a key with the front desk of your complex<br>
    Leave a key with a neighbor </p> 
    <p>Most clients find using a hide-a-key or a lockbox to be the easiest way to give your walker access to your residence. This way, your keys never leave the property and you can change the location of the hide-a-key or the combination to the lockbox whenever you’d like. You can update this information in real time in the Trottr app.</p>

    <h2>Will my dog be walked with other dogs?</h2>
    <p>We want to give each pup the attention they deserve. It is for this reason that all of our walks are private.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" checked>
    <i></i>
    <h2>How do I know my dog has been walked?</h2>
    <p>The Trottr app uses GPS technology, giving dog owners the ability to see where their pup walked. Once a walk is completed, your walker will send you an invoice with the time and length of the walk, as well as a photo of your happy, tired pup.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" checked>
    <i></i>
    <h2>How do I pay my walker?</h2>
    <p>You will receive an invoice after each walk and can pay with all major credit cards. You will be charged only after you approve the invoice.</p>

    <h2>How does the Trottr rating system work?</h2>
    <p>It’s out of 5 stars, 5 is the highest rating and 1 is the lowest. In order to provide you with the highest level of service, we have a strict policy that all dog walkers must maintain 4.5 stars. Please rate your experience accurately so we can maintain the highest quality standards.</p>

    <i></i>
    <h2>Can I request a same day, on-demand walk?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely. If you are new to Trottr, simply download the app and request a walk after browsing through walkers in your area. The first walk is on us! If you're already a client, simply request a walk from your regular walker.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" checked>
    <i></i>
    <h2>How do I contact my walker?</h2>
    <p>The Trottr app has a chat function built into it to keep you in touch with your walker 24/7. For example, some owners that use Trottr 2-3 times a day when they are out of town use the chat function to check in with their walker to see how their dog is doing. Other owners use the chat function to ask about availability or any other general inquiries.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" checked>
    <i></i>
    <h2>How do I change my schedule?</h2>
    <p>Easy. Click on Scheduled Walks on the Nav bar. You can add walks to the calendar as needed, or you can simply click on a day where you already have a walk scheduled if you need to cancel. To reschedule, simply drag and drop the “walk” on an available time slot. That’s it!</p>

    <h2>Free Trial</h2>
    <p>By making the open state default for when :checked isn't detected, we can make this system accessable for browsers that don't recognize :checked. The fallback is simply an open accordion. The accordion can be manipulated with Javascript (if needed) by changing the "checked" property of the input element.</p>
